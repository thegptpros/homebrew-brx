# SwiftUI Blank Template

This is a minimal SwiftUI app template created with BRX.

## Getting Started

**Don't run xcodegen or xcodebuild manually!** Use BRX commands instead:

```bash
# Build the project
brx build

# Run the app with live reload
brx run

# Ship to TestFlight
brx ship

# Publish to App Store
brx publish
```

BRX handles all the complex Xcode commands behind the scenes with a clean, simple interface.

## What's Included

- Minimal SwiftUI app structure
- Basic ContentView
- Project configuration

## Next Steps

1. Run `brx build` to generate the Xcode project
2. Run `brx run` to start developing with live reload
3. Customize the app in `Sources/ContentView.swift`
